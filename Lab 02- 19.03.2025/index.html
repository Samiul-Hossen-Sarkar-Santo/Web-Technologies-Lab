                Assalamualaikum, <br>Hope you're doing well. First of all, I'd like to thank you for taking your time to visit my portfolio.
                And
                hopefully, I have something in common to what you're looking for. Keep reading to know more about me.
                Have a
                nice dayðŸ˜Š<br>
                Well, my journey in programming started with learning C in my first semester. But now I'm well
                acquainted
                with <b>C, Java, Dart, and a bit of C++</b>, and Iâ€™ve especially enjoyed working with Java. I'm currently
                looking
                into the world of software development, as I believe itâ€™s my niche. Iâ€™ve also taken a keen interest in
                <b>cross-platform app development</b>, exploring tools like <b>Flutter</b>. And my journey in designing started when I
                joined IEEE BUP SB WIE Affinity Group. I started it out of sheer curiosity and soon found a deep
                interest in
                the field. While I acknowledge the fact that I'm not a pro in designing, I most surely enjoy it to the
                fullest. I started designing using Canva and eventually learned Adobe Illustrator for more advanced
                designs
                and demands. I love the creative freedom that designing allows me, and I find it incredibly satisfying
                to
                see my ideas come to life on the screen. I hope to continue honing my skills in both software
                development
                and design, as I believe the combination of the two will make me a well-rounded and versatile
                professional
                in the tech industry. My ultimate goal is to work on innovative projects that push the boundaries of
                technology and creativity.<br>

            <p>
                Vocab Victory is a console-based word guessing game designed to test and improve your vocabulary skills.
                It was build entirely using <strong>Java</strong>. And I've also implemented the Object-Oriented
                Programming concept in this project. The game challenges players to guess an English word letter by
                letter based on a given hint.

            <p>
                ChopSticks is a traditional hand game usually played between two players. This was also built using
                <strong>Java</strong> entirely. The Object-Oriented Programming concept was implemented in this project
                as well. The goal is to outmaneuver your opponent using strategic hand movements.
